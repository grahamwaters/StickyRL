# improvements
1. create randomized depth in the water by varying shades of blue.
2. Add 25-30% randomly generated aquatic plantlife for the fish to hide in, explore, and to make the lake more realistic. It should move slightly as if anchored to the lake floor.
3. Add a snapping turtle agent that suns itself on the islands and tries to eat the fish. It should be smaller and slower than the red predator.
4. Add randomized exploration to the fish so that they behave as real fish would. They should be able to be still and also drift in the clockwise pond current without increasing their hunger.
5. Fish agents should have:
   1. hunger
   2. energy
   3. experience
   4. health
   5. boldness (varies from timid to brave) which determines actions taken in the face of danger.
   6. wisdom (from previous epochs of training data gathered by previous fish in the same role)
